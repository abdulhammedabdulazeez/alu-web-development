# Project Title

Webpage Implementation from Designer File

## Description

This project aims to help students learn and practice HTML by implementing a webpage from a designer file. The focus is on creating the HTML structure using semantic markup, without adding any CSS or styling. It's all about pure HTML for now!

To begin, I will have access to a designer file on Figma, a fantastic web-based design tool widely used in the industry. With this resource, I can visually see how the webpage should look and aim to replicate it with my HTML code.

## Getting Started

To embark on this exciting project, I will follow these steps:

1. Access the designer file on Figma.
   - I will visit [Figma]([https://www.figma.com](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?type=design&node-id=3558-0&t=n92xrUQnDHqWbVEk-0)) and open the specific designer file provided for this project.

2. Familiarize myself with the design.
   - I will take my time to carefully examine the designer file, studying its layout, structure, and components, ensuring I understand its intricacies.

3. Create an HTML file.
   - Using my preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE), I will create a new HTML file to begin my coding journey.

4. Implement the HTML structure.
   - Applying my knowledge of HTML and semantic markup, I will diligently recreate the webpage's structure, staying true to the design specifications.

5. Test my HTML code.
   - To ensure the accuracy of my implementation, I will open the HTML file in a web browser and verify that the structure is displayed correctly, with all elements in their designated positions.

## Requirements

To succeed in this project, I will need:

- Basic knowledge of HTML and semantic markup.
- A reliable text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write my HTML code.
- A web browser to test and view my webpage.

## Resources

The following resources will be useful throughout this project:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - An online design tool where I can access the designer file.
- [HTML Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) guide for HTML, serving as a valuable reference.
